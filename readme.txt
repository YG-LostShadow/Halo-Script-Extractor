Improvements by: kornman00

 

Description:
Extracts and formats script data from any Halo/Stubbs the Zombie map file. From there, you can save the extracted scripts to a .hsc file that can be compiled.

Notes:
You may need to run as an administrator for this to work correctly.
If it says you are missing file(s), you need to download and install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 runtime components here: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=a7b7a05e-6de6-4d3a-a423-37bf0912db84&displaylang=en
